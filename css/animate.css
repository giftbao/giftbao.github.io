/* NOTES from ThemesCollective
 *
 * Custom build of the necessary animations needed for franco html template.
 * The full range of animations can be found in the 'animations' folder in your template package.
 *
 */

/* ThemesCollective Note: CURRENT ANIMATIONS
 * We have only included the four animations we have used here, (fadeInUp, fadeInRight, fadeInLeft & fadeInLeftBig), instead of the whole library for better page-load times. Add more to this file if you need require other animation types. The full library is included in your template package, in the 'libs' folder. You can also visit the plugin authors' site, http://daneden.me/animate for more options.
